# Task
A tile company wants to provide customers with a tile calculator.

Assumptions:
All rooms are rectangular.
All tiles are square.

Further information:
The whole of the floor has to be covered.
If a fraction of a tile is needed a whole tile must be bought.
The floor on the right would therefore need 30 tiles to be purchased.

Input:
There are three lines of input:
Length of room
Width of room
Tile edge length

Output:
An integer that is equal to the number of tiles that are needed to be purchased.

Example input:
100
50
5

Example output:
200

Constraints:
Length of room provided will always be an integer from 1 to 200.
Width of room provided will always be an integer from 1 to 100.
The tile edge length provided will always be a value from 0.1 to 10 and accurate to one decimal place.

Task:
Write a program that reads the test data from standard input.
Your program should then calculate the number of tiles required and send the result to standard output.
